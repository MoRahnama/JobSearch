## Introduction

The main focus of this repository is to provide a real-life example of coding assignments frequently encountered during technical interviews in the tech industry. The codes are accompanied by the resume I used for my job search, which showcases my experience and skills.

## Code_Samples

`Code_Samples` directory contains code samples written in various programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.) that demonstrate my problem-solving skills. The challenges are grouped by the company where the interview took place or the problem type, such as data structures, algorithms, design patterns, etc.

Every code file is commented to explain the logic and the approach behind solving the problem. Feel free to study these examples to prepare for your interviews or improve your coding skills.

## Resume

In the `Resume` directory, you will find the resume I have used during my job search. It highlights my experience, skills, and projects. It is a good reference for those who are preparing their resumes and want to see a real-life example.
