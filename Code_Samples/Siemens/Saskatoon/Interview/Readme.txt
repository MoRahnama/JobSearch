This code (Interview.py) analyzes traffic collisions in Toronto that resulted in fatalities or serious injuries between 2006 and 2021. It fetches the data from the City of Toronto's Open Data portal, processes the data, and visualizes the results using density maps and histograms.

The main steps the code performs are:

Fetch traffic collision data from the City of Toronto's Open Data portal and convert it to a GeoDataFrame.
Extract latitude and longitude coordinates from the collision data.
Fetch traffic signals data from the City of Toronto's Open Data portal and process it.
Calculate the distance from each traffic collision event to the nearest traffic signal.
Visualize the data using a density map and a histogram.
The visualizations help in understanding the spatial distribution of traffic collisions, as well as the distribution of collision distances to the nearest traffic signals.

To run this code, you need to install the following packages:

requests: Required to make HTTP requests to fetch data from the Open Data portal.
json: Required to parse and process JSON data.
geopandas: Required to handle and process geospatial data.
pandas: Required for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: Required to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
contextily: Required to add basemaps to the geopandas plots.
seaborn: Required to create statistical graphics in Python.
numpy: Required for numerical computations in Python.
scipy: Required for scientific computing and technical computing.

To install these packages, you can use pip:
pip install requests json geopandas pandas matplotlib contextily seaborn numpy scipy

The results of this code provide insights into the spatial distribution of traffic collisions, as well as their relationship with traffic signals. This information can be useful for traffic engineers, urban planners, and policymakers to identify high-risk areas and develop interventions to improve traffic safety. The density map shows where collisions are concentrated, and the histogram illustrates the distribution of distances between collisions and the nearest traffic signals.
